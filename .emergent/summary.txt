The AI engineer successfully developed a comprehensive, high-end artisanal jewelry web application from initial requirements to a near-complete state. The process involved establishing a full-stack architecture (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) and iteratively implementing complex features. Key challenges included designing an intuitive, customizable web app using an admin panel, creating a hidden access mechanism (5 clicks in the bottom-right corner, 30-second timer, then login), and developing a functional image editor that saves base64 images. The approach demonstrates a clear focus on user needs and iterative refinement, aiming for a premium user experience.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a web application for a high-end artisanal jewelry catalog. The application must not display prices by default but feature distinct collection sections and the artisan's story. A core requirement is an intuitive, authorized admin panel, allowing the artisan (without technical knowledge) full control over the web app: creating, editing, and deleting collections, jewelry items, titles, text, items and collections info, etc. This panel must include an image editor for uploads (brightness, contrast, saturation) and allow selection from three color schemes. The website needs to be 100% responsive, adapt its logo size on scroll, and feature editable artisan details, site name, all section titles/texts, and a customizable elegant footer. The footer should include configurable (activate/deactivate) social media icons (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, YouTube, Twitter/X). Access to the admin panel must be hidden, activated by 5 clicks/taps on a variable, invisible area, followed by a 30-second timer to show the access button, then requiring user/password login. All interactive elements must be functional and the web app has to be able to save any change done by the artisan in his admin panel.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based for secure admin panel access.
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS for styling, responsive design, advanced animations (parallax, scroll reveal).
-   **Image Handling**: Images stored as Base64 strings, client-side editing.
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor for service management.
-   **Data Management**: CRUD operations, environment variables for configuration.
</key_technical_concepts>
<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a standard full-stack architecture:



-   ****: This file hosts the FastAPI backend, implementing API endpoints for core application logic. It handles user authentication (admin/admin123 credentials), manages CRUD operations for  (site-wide customizable settings like name, artisan story, contact info, social links), , and . It also contains the logic for saving edited images, which are stored in Base64 format.
    -   **Changes Made**: Expanded  model to support extensive customization (25+ fields), added  endpoint, and implemented social media management logic.
-   ****: The main React component that structures the user interface and integrates with the backend. It manages the application's state, routes, and user interactions. Key features include the public catalog view, the responsive header and footer, and the comprehensive admin panel. The admin panel features five tabs for managing General settings, Site Texts, Social Media links, Collections, and Jewelry Items, including image editing.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented the secret admin access mechanism (5 clicks in the bottom-right corner, 30-second timer, then login). Developed the multi-tab admin panel with full CRUD capabilities. Integrated the image editor with actual saving functionality. Significant refactoring and debugging were done to ensure all text fields were editable, the authentication flow was correct, and to resolve various UI/UX issues, including a persistent custom cursor problem (which was ultimately removed). The current focus is on fixing data saving issues in the admin panel due to state management.
-   ****: This file contains the CSS styles for the React application, heavily utilizing Tailwind CSS for a sleek, modern aesthetic. It defines global styles, component-specific styles, and animations for effects like parallax and scroll reveal.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial styling for a functional but beautiful base UI. Added styles for custom cursor effects (later removed), smooth transitions, parallax, and reveal animations. Extensive cleanup was performed to remove all custom cursor-related CSS properties and classes (, ) to ensure native cursor behavior and compatibility across devices, especially on touch-enabled tablets with external mice.

<pending_tasks>
-   The primary pending task is to resolve the critical issue where changes made within the admin panel's configuration and content sections are not persistently saved due to the  state in  not being correctly initialized or updated.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing a critical bug in the admin panel: modifications to site configuration, texts, and social media settings are not being saved. Debugging revealed that the  state in , which holds the temporary edits, is being initialized or updated as an empty object (). Consequently, when the save action is triggered, an empty object is sent to the backend, failing to persist any user changes.

The debug process involved:
1.  Reviewing backend logs, which indicated no PUT/POST requests for saving were reaching the server, suggesting a frontend issue.
2.  Inspecting the  function and related state management in .
3.  Attempting multiple fixes by modifying how  is initialized and updated, and verifying 's operation.
4.  Adding detailed console logs to the frontend () to trace the  state during interactions.
5.  Analyzing browser console outputs from a recent screenshot, which definitively showed , confirming the empty object issue.

The immediate focus is to correctly initialize  with the existing  data when the admin panel is loaded, ensuring user edits are applied to a valid and populated state object before being sent to the backend.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to correctly initialize the  state in  with the  data to enable saving of admin panel modifications.

El se está actualizando como un objeto vacío en lugar de recibir los datos de . Esto significa que cuando el usuario edita los campos, no hay datos base para modificar, y cuando intenta guardar, está enviando un objeto vacío. Voy a corregir esto: (Chat Message 144)
